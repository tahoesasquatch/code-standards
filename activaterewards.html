			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Terms and Conditions</td>

				<td>Terms and Conditions for generic HMM site (can be shared accross all HMM PAH sites)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Terms and Conditions</td>
				<td>HMM PAH</td>
				<td>Skyfall</td>
				<td>terms_and_conditions_hmm_skyfall.thtml</td>
				<td>Terms and Conditions specific to HMM PAH Skyfall promotion (most likely used by skyfall controller)</td>
			</tr>
