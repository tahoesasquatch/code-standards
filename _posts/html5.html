	<h1>HTML5</h1>

	<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-webstandards/index.html">HTML5</a> is a new version of HTML and XHTML. The <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">HTML5 draft</a> specification defines a single language that can be written in HTML and XML. It attempts to solve issues found in previous iterations of HTML and addresses the needs of <em>Web Applications</em>, an area previously not adequately covered by HTML. (<a href="http://html5.org/">source</a>)</p>


	<h3>Use of new semantic elements</h3>
	
	<p>Elements such as <code>header, footer, section, article</code>, and others, can be used multiple times on a page, and more than once within one or the other even. In cases where there will be more than one of the same element, that is used for the same thing such as using <code>article</code> for each blog post of a page and each article having a <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code>, adding a class to them can help separate them from any other places you may use these elements on the page. That way you can target the elements more specifically in your CSS.</p>

		<header>
			<h1>Logo and main page title here</h1>
		</header>
		
		<article>
			<header>
				<h1>Blog post title number one?</h1>			
			</header>
			<p>My post content and things are blah...</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<header>
				<h1>I sometimes wake up in code sweats</h1>
			</header>
			<p>I write code in my dreams. Sometimes they can be semantic nightmares.</p>
		</article>
